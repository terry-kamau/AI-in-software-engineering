## Test Analysis

Our Testim.io implementation successfully automated login page validation with 75% step completion (6/8 steps passed) in 42 seconds. While the free tier restricted CSV parameterization, we achieved:

1. **Efficient Test Creation**  
   Recorded complete login/logout flow in under 20 minutes without coding - approximately 3x faster than equivalent Selenium scripting.

2. **Reliable Element Handling**  
   Testim's AI locators maintained stability despite:
   - Dynamic page transitions
   - Post-logout state changes
   - Form re-rendering

3. **Key Results**  
   - Verified successful authentication (Secure Area detection)
   - Validated logout functionality
   - Detected UI state errors (28s failure revealed post-logout page issue)

4. **Limitations Addressed**  
   Workarounds developed for:
   - Viewport sizing (manual 1024x768 setting)
   - Data-driven testing (hardcoded values)
   - Free-tier execution constraints

The built-in reporting provided actionable insights, though the 28-second failure indicates need for additional synchronization. This demonstrates AI-powered testing's viability for core authentication workflows, with paid features likely resolving observed limitations.
