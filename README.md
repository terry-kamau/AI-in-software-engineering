## Overview
This project explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence in software engineering, focusing on development efficiency, automation, testing, analytics, and ethical implications. It is divided into three main parts:

---

## Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (30%)

### 1.1 Short Answer Questions

**Q1:** How AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time and their limitations.  
**Q2:** Comparison of supervised vs unsupervised learning in automated bug detection.  
**Q3:** Importance of bias mitigation in AI-powered UX personalization.

### 1.2 Case Study Analysis

**Case Study:** *AI in DevOps: Automating Deployment Pipelines*  
**Question:** How AIOps enhances software deployment efficiency?  
**Deliverable:** Written response with two examples.

---

## Part 2: Practical Implementation (60%)

### Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

- **Tool Used:** GitHub Copilot / Tabnine  
- **Objective:** Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key.  
- **Deliverables:**
  - AI-generated vs manual code comparison
  - 200-word efficiency analysis

### Task 2: Automated Testing with AI

- **Tool Used:** Selenium IDE with AI plugin / Testim.io  
- **Objective:** Automate login test cases (valid and invalid credentials)  
- **Deliverables:**
  - Test script and result screenshots  
  - 150-word summary on AI test coverage

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

- **Dataset:** Breast Cancer Dataset (Kaggle)  
- **Objective:** Train a model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict issue priority (High/Medium/Low)  
- **Steps:**
  - Data cleaning, labeling, splitting  
  - Model training and evaluation (Accuracy, F1-score)  
- **Deliverable:** Jupyter Notebook with performance metrics

---

## Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)

**Prompt:** The deployed model may reflect biases (e.g., underrepresented teams).  
**Task:** Discuss:
- Potential dataset biases
- Mitigation using IBM AI Fairness 360

---

## Bonus Task (Optional +10%)

### Innovation Challenge

**Objective:** Propose a unique AI tool to solve an unaddressed software engineering problem.  
**Deliverable:** 1-page proposal detailing:
- Tool purpose
- Workflow
- Expected impact
