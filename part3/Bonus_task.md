### **Bonus Task: Innovation Challenge**

**Title:** AI-Powered AutoDoc â€“ Intelligent Documentation Generator for Codebases

**Purpose:**
In many software projects, poor or outdated documentation slows down onboarding, collaboration, and maintenance. AutoDoc is an AI-driven tool designed to automatically generate and update technical documentation by analyzing source code, commit messages, and developer comments. It reduces manual effort and ensures documentation evolves with the code.

**Workflow:**

1. **Code Parsing:**
   AutoDoc uses static analysis and NLP to parse code structures (functions, classes, modules) across multiple languages.

2. **Contextual Learning:**
   Using trained language models (e.g., CodeBERT or GPT-based), it interprets code behavior and developer intentions from commit messages and inline comments.

3. **Documentation Generation:**
   It generates function-level docstrings, module overviews, and API references in formats like Markdown or reStructuredText.

4. **Change Monitoring:**
   Integrated into CI/CD pipelines, AutoDoc detects code changes and updates documentation automatically, with a changelog.

5. **User Review Interface:**
   A web interface allows developers to review, edit, or approve suggested docs before committing them.

**Impact:**

* Reduces time spent on writing or updating documentation
* Improves onboarding for new developers
* Increases code maintainability and transparency
* Helps enforce documentation standards across teams

**Optional Extensions:**

* Plugin for GitHub/GitLab
* Integration with IDEs (e.g., VS Code) for live documentation previews
* Support for multilingual documentation (via translation models)
